# respiration-rate-algorithm

This repository holds a MATLAB script I wrote for a candidate assessment to determine the respiration rate for a raw, noisy respiration signal. Due to IP concerns, I cannot share the data I used for the assessment. However, the MATLAB script I used to analyze the data provided is uploaded here to show the steps I took.
